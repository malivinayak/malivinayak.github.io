### GitHub Issue: New Portfolio Website Development

**Objective:**  
Create a new personal portfolio website using the existing data from my current webpage.

**Requirements:**

- Develop the website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- Utilize **JSON** to store project data, enabling dynamic updates. When new projects are added to the JSON file, they should automatically appear on the webpage.

**Example Project Data Structure:**

```json
{
  "name": "Auxpert - Your Automotive Expert",
  "technologies": "Figma, Canva, Dart, TypeScript, Node.js, Firebase",
  "description": "Developed a cross-platform mobile application for car service booking.",
  "url": "abc.com"
}
```
